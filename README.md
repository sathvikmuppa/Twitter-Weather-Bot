# Twitter-Weather-Bot
A bot that tweets the daily forecast at 7:00 AM CST and the weather every 4 hours.

This bot uses BeautifulSoup to read weather.com, the openweathermap.org api to get weather info, and tweepy in order to tweet.

The access tokens and consumer keys were generated at developer.twitter.com and are in a dictionary in a seperate file.

The bot tweets on the account @SLANDWeather on twitter.
